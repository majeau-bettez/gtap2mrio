# GTAP2MRIO

A simple python class to convert GTAP data into a multi-regional input-output table, following the method of Peters et al. (2011):

## Very much a work in progress

There is no code on the master branch, as the whole project is very much still in beta testing and does not fully integrate all equations from Peters et al.
